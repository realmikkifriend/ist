# UX Strategy: Ist

Developed by Mikki Friend.

## 1. Introduction & Background

I have always had extra trouble completing the tasks of daily living. I designed Ist over many years and iterations, incorporating the knowledge of occupational therapists (those who study how to help people do things better) to support the following executive functions:

-   **Task prioritization**: I am very good at making a detailed list of everything I need to do. But when I try to do the things on the list, I have trouble figuring out which are most important or need to be done in order.

-   **Task initiation**: If I'm not confident that the next task is the 'right' thing to do next, I procrastinate and lose track of time.

-   **Sustained attention**: I find it hard to stay focused on one thing for a long time. I work best when the task is broken down into smaller steps, presented one at a time. I can multitask within reason, as long as I am reminded to not forget about a task while doing others.

-   **Working memory**: If I can't work on a task right now, I don't want to see it and risk being distracted. I would rather have tasks hidden until I need them.

Ist helps people like me complete tasks with less distraction.

### 1.1. Pre-Production Deliverables

The following UX deliverables were created during planning:

-   This project proposal
-   User personae (see below)

Since this app uses a relatively simple design and is based on a private functioning prototype, I skipped wireframing.

### 1.2. Glossary

-   **context**: The place or situation in which one can accomplish a task, whether general or specific (e.g. the context of 'brush teeth' can be 'home' or 'bathroom'; 'buy milk' is accomplished in 'errands' or 'the grocery store down the street').
-   **defer**: To delay a task until later.
-   **goal**: A result that a person wants to see in their lives. Reaching a goal often involves both projects and gradual personal growth.
-   **priority**: How important and urgent a task is to the user.
-   **project**: A larger set of tasks that must be completed (usually in order) to create a larger result.
-   **task**: A set of steps that must be completed to create a result. Can repeat, or be part of a larger project.
-   **tasks of daily living**: Encompasses two occupational therapy concepts:
    -   _Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)_ must be completed to live a healthy life, such as feeding, grooming, and other self-care.
    -   _Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)_ are important to maintaining an independent life, and include cooking, housecleaning, and managing time and information.

## 2. Project Proposal

<!-- Write this last. Introductory paragraph that sums up each of the sections below. -->

### 2.1. Problem Statement & Scope

-   pain points found during user research
-   scope based on user personae

### 2.2. Proposed Solution

<!-- Clearly state the solution to the problem identified in the research. Include any supporting evidence or research findings. -->

### 2.3. Analysis

#### 2.3.1 Competitive Analysis

<!-- Assess the strengths and weaknesses in existing competitors, and opportunities and threats in the market (SWOT analysis). Highlight feature ideas that are not currently represented in the market or could be vastly improved. Ensure understanding of industry standards. Create a UX value proposition that draws clear comparisons between the current app (or idea), its potential final state, and existing competitors. -->

#### 2.3.2 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

<!-- Potential risks and challenges based on user research and competitive analysis findings, as well as potential mitigation. Ensures proactive risk management and minimizes project disruptions. -->

### 2.4. Requirements

<!-- Specific, measurable goals for delivery. For a new app, a bullet-pointed list of the app's essential functionality (minimum viable product). For an existing app, improvement objectives such as streamlined navigation, visual redesign, and new features. -->

### 2.5. Stakeholders & Communication Plan

<!-- People, teams, and organizations involved in the project, and what level of communicationand involvement they expect. How to coordinate between stakeholders, including frequency of meetings, reporting structures, and communication channels. -->

### 2.6 Technical & Resource Requirements

<!-- A list of required resources, which will start vague and become more detailed over time. Server needs, ideally with scaling. Whether, what type, and how much data storage is needed. Desired qualities in the final technology stack, such as programming languages, frameworks, APIs, etc. Budget and expenses, both for development and ongoing hosting and maintenance. Allocating key roles and responsibilities to team members. -->

### 2.7 Timeframe

<!-- A specific or general timeframe for development, from start to delivery of MVP and beyond. General milestones based on measureable outcomes. -->

### 2.8. Evaluation & Success Measures

<!-- How the project will be monitored and evaluated. Specific and quantifiable success measures corresponding to objectives. -->

## 3. User Research

<!-- An overview of the research conducted and brief summary of the deliverables. -->

### 3.1. User Personae

Because I'll probably be the only user, I created a basic 'new user' persona and another about myself.

-   A [new user persona](persona-new.md)

| User Summary | Anyone (18-45), _A New User_                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Background   | Basic familiarity with tech                        |
| Goals        | Saving trouble & being more productive             |
| Frustrations | Long/complicated on-boarding, bugs & interruptions |
| Needs        | Minimal effort & buy-in, clear & simple interface  |
| Attitudes    | Open to new methodology, wants easy as possible    |

-   A [neurodivergent user persona](persona-nd.md)

| User Summary | Mikki (30s), _A Neurodivergent User_   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Background   | Educated & familiar with tech          |
| Goals        | Get help prioritizing task list        |
| Frustrations | Too much information, distractions     |
| Needs        | Clear & simple navigation              |
| Attitudes    | Appreciates structure & predictability |

In conclusion, needs analysis shows:

-   User Backgrounds: Basic to expert at tech, neurotypical or neurodivergent
-   User Goals: Prioritization, focus, accomplishment
-   User Frustrations: Complication, distraction, bugs, interruptions
-   User Needs: Clear & simple interface, minimal onboarding
-   User Attitudes: Open to new ideas as long as they are structured and easy to use
