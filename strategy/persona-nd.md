# A Neurodivergent User

A neurodivergent user has decided to start using this app.

## Demographic Background

-   15+ years old
-   diagnoses might include autism, ADHD, ARFID, dyslexia, cognitive impairment
-   may or may not live alone, be employed
-   familiar with web technology

## Goals & Motivations

They would like to complete more tasks in a given day, especially IATLs. They are organized enough to have their tasks entered into Todoist, but have a lot of trouble choosing a task on which to focus at any given moment.

There are also frequent cognitive operations for which Todoist doesn't provide tools, such as checklists, complex subtask operations, and automatically bringing overdue tasks current.

They are looking for a tool to fill these gaps in cognition and functionality.

## Needs

They need clear and simple navigation with structure and predictability. They are hesitant to change because it is challenging to learn new methods. Information needs to be laid out in clear, readable ways.

## Pain Points

They are frustrated by to-do apps that show the entire task list, without helping them decide how to prioritize or select a task to work on. They are easily distracted by both concepts and visual noise and animations. They will complain about or even stop using an app that is inconsistent and unpredictable.

## Technology

They have learned enough technology to navigate the web and self-accomodate their sensory needs to an extent. Their internet connection is adequate, and they use a modern browser and smartphone.

## Accessibility Concerns

It is important that the interface help them focus. They prefer reduced visual noise and flickering.
