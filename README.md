# Ist

Ist is a micro-app that reads your task list from [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), then displays the most important task that can currently be worked on.

If you paste a [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) URL into a Todoist comment, it will be converted into an interactive checklist.

For more about the design of this app, see [the project proposal](/strategy/strategy.md).
